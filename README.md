# Programming Challenges

Here is a list of simple Programming Challenges from my school with solutions to them.   
Generally one file contains the question and two versions, with Version 2 being the newest version.

### Challenge 1: How much does a booklet weigh?
90 – 120 GSM paper: The average weight of regular office paper or copy paper.   
130 – 250 GSM paper: The weight most commonly used for promotional posters.   

Your program should accept inputs from the user and output the weight of their booklet.
